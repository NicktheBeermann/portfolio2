        <h1>Nick Beermann Junior Developer</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, I am a Junior Software Developer 
            at Proforma based in Tampa, FL. I wrote
            my first line of code 2 weeks ago and have
            been going with the flow since then. I look
            forward to learning many more excited new
            things about the world of software development
            as well as honing my skills in the way of 
            programming.
